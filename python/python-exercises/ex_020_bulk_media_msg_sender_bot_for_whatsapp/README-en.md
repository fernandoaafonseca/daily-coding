# Automated bot for sending bulk multimedia messages on WhatsApp

## Description:

* Mass message sender bot for WhatsApp using your contacts' and/or groups' names. ü§ñ
* Text message with an option to include an image or video, as well as automatic personalization of each message using the contact and/or group name.
* The bot has clear instructions and usage tips throughout its execution. üìù
* Available in: <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/197/197386.png" width="15" height="15" alt="Brazil" /> **Portuguese** and <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/323/323329.png" width="15" height="15" alt="United Kingdom" /> **English** .

> *I recommend sending a test message to yourself to understand how everything works. For those who don't know, just add your own number as a contact in your address book and you can send messages to your own WhatsApp user.*

## About the project:

* This is my first personal programming project.
* It was created in **Python** üêç for hobby to apply and demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have acquired so far in various programming topics, such as: *modularization, code organization, object-oriented programming, inheritance, input validation, error and exception handling, automation* among others. And also explore the use of the terminal as much as possible, trying to make it as pleasant as possible using good formatting, as well as animate and color the texts. It was a very "artisanal" process to make it as intuitive as possible, even without the use of a graphical interface.
* I did my best to make it "round", handling all the bugs I could find. If you find any bug, let me know! üßë‚Äçüîß

> *This is a tool created for educational purposes only. I am not responsible for any misuse of the app. Do not abuse it to send spam or bother your friends. üòâ*

## üí° Status known issues

- I personally only tested it on Windows 11 (CMD and PowerShell), but it should theoretically work well on most operating systems, including Linux and MacOS.

If the user corrects the inputs too many times, the terminal may start to slow down. I'm an amateur, so any tips regarding this will be welcome!

The app does not correctly verify if the user enters a non-existent contact or group name.

If something doesn't work for you or doesn't do what you expect, I would love to hear your feedback. You can contact me through any of the means below.

## üë®‚Äçüíª To developers:

- I hope the code is fairly readable. Sorry for the comments only in Portuguese!
- It's worth remembering that websites are reformulated from time to time, so I don't know if the bot will be working perfectly when you test it. If you know the basics of web scraping, simply update the CSS and XPATH selector variables of the msg_sender.py module to those that WhatsApp Web is using at the moment.
- To prevent WhatsApp Web from asking you to scan the QR code every time you use the application, you can "uncomment" this section of code within the "init_webdriver()" function of the "bot.py" module and replace the installation directory of my Chrome with yours:

  ```
  options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
  options.add_argument(
              r'--user-data-dir=C:\\Users\\ferna\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\')
  self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(
              executable_path=r'C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver.exe', options=options)
  ```
