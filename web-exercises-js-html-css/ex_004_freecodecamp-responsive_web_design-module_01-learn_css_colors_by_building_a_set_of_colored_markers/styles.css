Is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value. It can accept two or more arguments. Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line.

--- BOX-SHADOW:
Lets you apply one or more shadows around an element. The blurRadius and spreadRadius are optional.
