/*
  --- FLEXBOX:
    Is a one-dimensional CSS layout that can control the way items are spaced out and aligned within a container. Any direct children of a flex container are called flex items.
    - display: flex;

  --- FLEX-DIRECTION:
    Flexbox has a main and cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, which has four possible values:
      - row (default): horizontal axis with flex items from left to right;
      - row-reverse: horizontal axis with flex items from right to left;
      - column: vertical axis with flex items from top to bottom;
      - column-reverse: vertical axis with flex items from bottom to top.
    Note: The axes and directions will be different depending on the text direction. The values shown are for a left-to-right text direction.
    - flex-direction: column;

  --- FLEX-WRAP:
    Determines how your flex items behave when the flex container is too small. Setting it to wrap will allow the items to wrap to the next row or column. nowrap (default) will prevent your items from wrapping and shrink them if needed.
    - flex-wrap: nowrap;

  --- JUSTIFY-CONTENT:
    Determines how the items inside a flex container are positioned along the main axis, affecting their position and the space around them.
    - justify-content: center;

  --- ALIGN-ITEMS:
    Positions the flex content along the cross axis. In this case, with your flex-direction set to row, your cross axis would be vertical.
    - align-items: center;
  
  --- GAP:
    The gap property and its row-gap and column-gap sub-properties provide this functionality for flex, grid, and multi-column layout. You apply the property to the container element.
    - gap: XXpx;

/*
  --- IMAGES ASPECT RATIO:
    Rather than setting each aspect ratio individually, you can use the object-fit property to determine how images should behave. Set the object-fit property to cover. This will tell the image to fill the img container while maintaining aspect ratio, resulting in cropping to fit.
    - object-fit: cover;

.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 350px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: cover;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

/*
  --- AFTER:
    The ::after pseudo-element creates an element that is the last child of the selected element. You can use it to add an empty element after the last image. If you give it the same width as the images it will push the last image to the left when the gallery is in a two-column layout. Right now, it is in the center because you set justify-content: center on the flex container.

        content: "";
