Escape Sequence Practice

Get some practice with escape sequences!  NO need to create new variables, just use the existing variables we have created for you and follow the instructions. :)

# Set the message variable equal to any string containing a new-line escape sequence
message = 'new \nline'
print(message)


# Add a string to the mountains variable that when printed results in: /\/\/\
# You will need to use an escape sequence more than once!
mountains = '/\\/\\/\\'
print(mountains)

# Set the quotation variable to any string that contains an escaped double quotation mark

quotation = 'These are quotation marks: \"'
print(quotation)
