Formatting Strings

Set the variable called first  to your first name.

Set the variable called last  to your last name.

Then set the variable called formatted  to a new string that interpolates both values (from the first and last variables) using f-strings or the .format()  method.  Make sure you follow this exact pattern for the new string that you store to the formatted variable (pay attention to capital/lowercase letters, spaces, commas, etc):

"First Name: Colt, Last Name: Steele"
'''


first = 'Fernando'
last = 'Fonseca'

formatted = f'First Name: {first}, Last Name: {last}'
