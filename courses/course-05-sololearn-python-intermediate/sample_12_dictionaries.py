'''
Dictionaries are collection types used to store data in key:value pairs, which are considered as items. They are ideal for organizing data into pairs, where each piece of data (value) has its unique identifier (key).

For example:
'''


product = {
  'name': 'pen',
  'color': 'red',
  'price': 79
}
