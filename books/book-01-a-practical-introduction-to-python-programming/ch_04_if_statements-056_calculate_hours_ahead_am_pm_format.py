'''
Write a program that asks the user for an hour between 1 and 12, asks them to enter am or pm, and asks them how many hours into the future they want to go. Print out what the hour will be that many hours into the future, printing am or pm as appropriate. An example is shown below.

Enter hour: 8
am (1) or pm (2)? 1
How many hours ahead? 5
New hour: 1 pm
