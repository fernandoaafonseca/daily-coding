'''
Ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius. The program should print a message based on the temperature:

	- If the temperature is less than -273.15, print that the temperature is invalid because it is below absolute zero.
	- If it is exactly -273.15, print that the temperature is absolute 0.
	- If the temperature is between -273.15 and 0, print that the temperature is below freezing.
	- If it is 0, print that the temperature is at the freezing point.
	- If it is between 0 and 100, print that the temperature is in the normal range.
	- If it is 100, print that the temperature is at the boiling point.
	- If it is above 100, print that the temperature is above the boiling point.
