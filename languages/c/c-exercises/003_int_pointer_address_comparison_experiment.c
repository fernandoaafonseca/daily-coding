/**
 * This code was written to explore a specific hypothesis:
 * "What happens if I compare an integer variable to the memory address of a string (char *) in C?"
 * 
 * In C, char * (a string or character pointer) is actually just a memory address â€” a number representing
 * where in memory the string begins. An int is also just a number. The user was wondering:
 * 
 * - If I assign an int x with the value of the address of y (a char *), and then compare x and y, will they be equal?
 * - Does C block this kind of comparison because they're different types?
 * - Could the int and the address match purely by coincidence?
 * 
 * The conclusion is:
 * - C allows this comparison (it gives a compiler warning, but still compiles and runs).
 * - The comparison will return true if the integer x holds the same numeric value as the address stored in y.
 * - C doesn't care about type safety at runtime for this; it just compares the bits.
 * - This is generally a bad idea unless you really intend to compare a number with an address.
 * 
 * The program prints whether x holds the same value as the address of y.
 * It pauses at the end so the output can be read before the console closes.
