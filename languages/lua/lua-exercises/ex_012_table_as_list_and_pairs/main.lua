Do the following:

    1. Create a table named 'numbers' containing 5 numeric values.

    2. Loop through it using:
            - numeric for (i = 1, #numbers)
            - pairs(numbers)

    3. Print both loops and observe the difference.

    4. Add comments explaining why #numbers works only for
       sequences without holes.
