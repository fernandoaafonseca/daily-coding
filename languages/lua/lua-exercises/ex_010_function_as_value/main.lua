Do the following:

    1. Create a function named 'square' and store it in a variable.

    2. Then assign the same function to a second variable named 'square_copy'.

    3. Call both variables and show that they behave identically.

    4. Add a comment explaining that in Lua, functions are values just like numbers or strings, and can be stored in variables or passed around freely.
